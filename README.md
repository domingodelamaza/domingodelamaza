Hi, I'm Domingo de la Maza from Chile, born in South Africa, and I'm an Industrial Engineer with a Master of Financial Management from The Australian National University, passionate about 
finance and technology.
I'm interested in learning more about Data Engineering, with the purpose of automation of data pipelines to have operational and financial data inside
the company, with velocity and veracity, and this way, companies can have real-time information with insights, KPIs, and financial ratios, for instant decision making

I have experience working in Chile and Australia in the manufacturing industry (consumer goods, concrete, and pocket door hardware), technology industry (IT & Telecom)
and real estate. I have worked in the Finance department and Operation departments.
